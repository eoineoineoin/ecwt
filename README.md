# Morse Trainer

An application for Android to teach morse code using the Koch method.

The Koch method introduces morse symbols one lesson at a time, allowing you to master each symbol before adding a new one. This pace makes it much easier to train your ear to recognise the symbols without becoming overwhelmed.

Also contains a sounder, allowing you to listen to whatever text you wish to send.
